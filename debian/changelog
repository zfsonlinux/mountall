mountall (0.1.6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Restored mistakenly removed dh_installchangelogs & dh_installdocs.
  * Allow a further udev event for a block-device to retry swapon/mount
    after fsck has been already been completed for a prior event.

  * Massively reduce the pickyness of mountall when it comes to block
    devices; only expect ID_FS_USAGE and ID_FS_TYPE for dm and md devices,
    and don't actually expect the values.  For most people this won't make
    a difference, since we use UUID= anyway.  But for people with hardcoded
    /dev/sda1 in their fstab, which has multiple metadata, this won't break
    their boot.

  * Only include FHS filesystems in the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems
    events.  This prevents an unmountable entry in fstab blocking things like
    starting D-Bus or the Network which are required to mount that filesystem.
    LP: #430880.
  * Never consider the root filesystem to be virtual or remote, even when
    it is, since we assert that it's already mounted so we don't have to
    take care of it.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Ignore errors from kill in mountall-net, since they're almost certainly
    just because mountall exited before we had a chance to kill it
    LP: #430755.

mountall (0.1.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [Johan Kiviniemi]
  * Don't run fsck when the device has already been marked ready.

  [Scott James Remnant]
  * Don't abort when we have nothing to copy into /dev and /var/run, or
    nothing to remove from /tmp

mountall (0.1.3) karmic; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems 
  * Failure to check or mount a filesystem that's not critical to the boot
    no longer results in immediate termination of mountall.
  * Failure to mount a remote filesystem no longer results in immediate
    termination of mountall, since these may be retried when other interfaces
    are brought up.
  * Improved error message output on mountall failure, temporarily enabled
    output so important messages aren't lost.
  * Removed /forcefsck after checks are complete.
