mountall (2.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * "mount" event changed to "mounting", to make it clear it happens
    before the filesystem is mounted.  Added "mounted" event which
    happens afterwards.
  * Dropped the internal hooks, these are now better handled by Upstart
    jobs on the "mounted" event.
  * Dropped the call to restorecon for tmpfs filesystems, this can also be
    handled by an Upstart job supplied by SELinux now.
    - mounted-dev.conf replaces /dev hook, uses MAKEDEV to make devices.
    - mounted-varrun.conf replaces /var/run hook
    - mounted-tmp.conf replaces /tmp hook.
      + Hook will be run for any /tmp mountpoint.  LP: #478392.
      + Switching back to using "find" fixes $TMPTIME to be in days again,
        rathern than hours.  LP: #482602
  * Try and make mountpoints, though we only care about failure if the
    mountpoint is marked "optional" since otherwise the filesystem might
    make the mountpoint or something.
  * Rather than hiding the built-in mountpoints inside the code, put them
    in a new /lib/init/fstab file; that way users can copy the lines into
    /etc/fstab if they wish to override them in some interesting way.
  * Now supports multiple filesystem types listed in fstab, the whole
    comma-separated list is passed to mount and then /proc/self/mountinfo
    is reparsed to find out what mount actually did.
    * /dev will be mounted as a devtmpfs filesystem if supported by the
      kernel (which then does not need to run the /dev hook script).
  * Filesystem checks may be forced by adding force-fsck to the kernel
    command-line.
  * Exit gracefully with an error on failed system calls, don't infinite
    loop over them.  LP: #469985.
  * Use plymouth for all user communication, replacing existing usplash and
    console code;
    * When plymouth is running, rather than exiting on failures, prompt the
      user as to whether to fix the problem (if possible), ignore the problem,
      ignore the mountpoint or drop to a maintenance shell.  LP: #489474.
    * If plymouth is not running for whatever reason, the fallback action
      is always to start the recovery shell.
  * Adjust the set of filesystems that we wait for by default: LP: #484234.
    * Wait for all local filesystems, except those marked with the
      "nobootwait" option.
    * Wait for remote filesystems mounted as, or under, /usr or /var, and
      those marked with the "bootwait" option.
  * Always try network mount points, since we allow them to fail silently;
    SIGUSR1 now simply retries them once more.  LP: #470776.
  * Don't retry devices repeatedly.  LP: #480564.
  * Added manual pages for the events emitted by this tool.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * Start all fsck instances in parallel, but set their priorities so that
    thrashing is avoided.  LP: #491389.

mountall (1.1) lucid; urgency=low

  * Update to use external libnih.
  * Updated autoconf details at same time to match libnih.
  * rcS is a job, not an event.  LP: #456806.

mountall (1.0) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * Call out to restorecon after mounting tmpfs filesystems.  LP: #456942.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * Fix a bug introduced by the 0.2.6 change. In certain situations, we’d
    quit even though we’re still waiting for some filesystems to be
    mounted.  LP: #456806.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Don't clear the splash screen when we're waiting for filesystems,
    instead just output following whatever else is there.  In non-verbose
    mode this won't look any different, but it means we don't clear previous
    verbose mode text.  LP: #458389.
  * Only update the "waiting for one or more mounts" text if there's actually
    a change in the set we're waiting for; this removes the need for a CLEAR
    this case anyway.
  * Don't say we're waiting for mounts we're, in fact, not waiting
    for.  LP: #459859.
  * Stop mountall (normally) when entering recovery mode.  LP: #458060.

  * Clean up source tarball.  LP: #460348.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 26 Oct 2009 09:30:41 +0000

mountall (0.2.6) karmic; urgency=low

  * Fix the bug where we never realise that we're down, because the
    fact the filesystem is mounted is updated from /proc/self/mountinfo
    rather than internally.  LP: #456806.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 21 Oct 2009 16:19:36 +0100

mountall (0.2.5) karmic; urgency=low

  * Filesystem check progress reporting, including cancellation.  LP: 446596.
  * When we're waiting for a mountpoint, if a few seconds of inactivity
    passes, report what we're waiting for and allow Escape to drop you to
    a recovery shell.
  * Start usplash for filesystem check progress reporting or when we've
    been waiting for more than a few seconds.  LP: #431184.

  * Hide error removing /forcefsck, people mis-report this as a bug and
    don't tell us the error above it.
  * Don't call mount.ecryptfs or mount.aufs when adding an entry for
    /etc/mtab; these helpers are broken and do not support the -f argument.
    This means your passphrase may end up in /etc/mtab, blame them not me.
    LP: #431954, #443080.
  * Unlink /etc/mtab~ after creating/truncating /etc/mtab and before writing
    mtab entries.  LP: #431865.
  * Stop the recovery shell if the user runs shutdown within it, so we
    don't run mountall again.  LP: #452196.
  * If the root filesystem check fails, we'll need to reboot, so just have
    the recovery shell script do that.

  * Post-review logic fixes.

mountall (0.2.2) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Don't emit the local-filesystem signal until after virtual filesystems
    are also done mounting.  LP: #448981.

  [ Robert Gerlach ]
  * Fix segfault when root filesystem missing from fstab, or listed
    as /dev/root.  LP: #448323.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * Don’t queue filesystem check when either device or type is "none".

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Removed /srv from the list of "essential" mountpoints.  LP: #448267.
  * Allow overriding of the above list by using the "bootwait" and
    "nobootwait" fstab options, e.g.

    LABEL=foo /home ext4 nobootwait 0 0

  * Mount /proc before attempting to parse /proc/filesystems.  LP: #447947.
  * Further improvements to event tagging of filesystems.  A virtual bootwait
    filesystem underneath a local or remote filesystem inherits that tag,
    a local bootwait filesystem underneath a remote filesystem inherits that
    tag, remote filesystems do not inherit them.  LP: #447654.

  * Replace previous hardcoded "arch specific" flag for /spu with an
    "optional" fstab mount option.
  * Made binfmt_misc,fusectl, debugfs, securityfs and /lib/init/rw optional
    as well.
  * Check whether the mountpoint of optional fstab entries exists before
    trying to mount, and skip over that if it doesn't.  LP: #447525.

  * Keep /proc/self/mountinfo open, if it changes while we're running,
    update the knowledge of the mount table and what's mounted.  That
    way if something else mounts it while mountall running, you'll still
    get events and mountall will still exit.
  * Try mounts again if another network device comes up while we were
    waiting.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 13 Oct 2009 02:17:47 +0100

mountall (0.2.1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Make mountall recognize that *remote* filesystems are still remote, given
    that their parent fs is almost always local.  LP: #447654.

mountall (0.2.0) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Always check the root filesystem if --force-fsck is used, regardless of
    passno.  LP: #435707.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * Have each fsck instance create a lock for each underlying physical device.
    If you have a single disk or RAID, all filesystem checks will happen
    sequentially in order to avoid thrashing.  On more complex configurations,
    you’ll benefit from the parallel checks mountall has been doing all along.
    LP: #434974.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Flush standard output and error before spawning processes to make
    capturing logs easier (otherwise we end up repeating things still in
    the buffer), and before calling exec().
  * Turn the code upside down so that each mount knows what it's waiting
    for, and allow multiple dependencies.  This makes the code much more
    readable putting the "policy" in a single function, and will make it
    much easier in future when this is done by Upstart.
  * For kernel filesystems listed in fstab, honour the order that they
    are listed in fstab.  LP: #432571, #433537, #436796
  * Always create new swap partition mounts for each fstab entry, don't
    treat them as updating the same.  LP: #435027.
  * Virtual filesystems under local or remote filesystems (and local under
    remote) don't delay the virtual or local events.  LP: #431040.
  * Simplify event emission, this has the advantage that we can now output
    what mount points we're waiting for and what they are waiting for as
    well.
  * Fixed issue with trailing slashes.  LP: #443035.
  * Only run hooks if the filesystem was not already mounted.  LP: #444252.
  * Don't clean up /tmp when run without --tmptime argument.
  * Ignore loop and ram devices until ready.  LP: #441454.
  * Add options to binfmt_misc filesystem, which will probably cause it to
    be mounted on boot as well.
  * Synchronously mount local and virtual filesystems, I suspect this is
    the real cause behind the XFS races as one will modprobe and the other
    will not (and fail).  LP: #432620.
  * Synchronously activate swap to avoid out of memory issues when checking
    the root filesystem.
  * Enumerate existing udev devices on startup, so we don't always have to
    see udev be coldplugged.
  * Don't break on general errors for non-essential filesystems.
    LP: #441144.
  * Don't repeat attempts to mount a filesystem without having first
    succeded to mount another.
  * Still restart mountall even if the recovery shell fails.
  * Don't queue filesystem check when device is "none", or missing, or the
    filesystem is marked nodev.
  * Generate a "mount" event before mounting a filesystem, and wait for its
    effects to complete.

mountall (0.1.8) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Further work on the fix from the previous version where the root
    filesystem would always be considered "local", retain that from the
    POV of the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems events, but do mount
    the root straight away when it's virtual since there's no device to
    wait until it's ready.  LP: #431204.
  * If a remote filesystem is already mounted and doesn't need a remount,
    don't wait for a network device to come up.  LP: #430348.

  * Ignore single and double quotes in fstab device specifications, since
    mount -a used to.  LP: #431064.
  * Never write mtab when mounting a mount with showthroughs (ie. /var)
    and instead update mtab once we've moved it into place
    later.  LP: #434172.

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * src/mountall.c: rework nftw hooks to use a global for argument passing
    instead of using nested functions and the resulting trampolines that
    cause an executable stack.  LP: #434813.
  * debian/rules: revert powerpc exception, since the cause is fixed by
    removing the nested functions.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 23 Sep 2009 14:19:01 -0700

mountall (0.1.7) karmic; urgency=low

  * Build with -O2 on powerpc to work around wrong-code generation with -Os.
    LP: #432222.

mountall (0.1.6) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Restored mistakenly removed dh_installchangelogs & dh_installdocs.

  * Allow a further udev event for a block-device to retry swapon/mount
    after fsck has been already been completed for a prior event.
  * Massively reduce the pickyness of mountall when it comes to block
    devices; only expect ID_FS_USAGE and ID_FS_TYPE for dm and md devices,
    and don't actually expect the values.  For most people this won't make
    a difference, since we use UUID= anyway.  But for people with hardcoded
    /dev/sda1 in their fstab, which has multiple metadata, this won't break
    their boot.

  * Only include FHS filesystems in the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems
    events.  This prevents an unmountable entry in fstab blocking things like
    starting D-Bus or the Network which are required to mount that filesystem.
    LP: #430880.
  * Never consider the root filesystem to be virtual or remote, even when
    it is, since we assert that it's already mounted so we don't have to
    take care of it.  LP: #431028.
  * Check whether filesystems mounted readonly when we start do not have
    "ro" in their fstab, before assuming we need to remount them.
    Readonly filesystems not in fstab (e.g. LiveCD, Wubi, etc.) never need
    remounting.  LP: #431028.
  * Only virtual filesystems will be mounted while the root filesystem is
    readonly, not filesystems such as /usr and /var.
  * fuse filesystems are never considered virtual, since they probably
    need devices, write access and the hand of god to be mounted.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Ignore errors from kill in mountall-net, since they're almost certainly
    just because mountall exited before we had a chance to kill it
    LP: #430755.

mountall (0.1.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [Johan Kiviniemi]
  * Don't run fsck when the device has already been marked ready.

  [Scott James Remnant]
  * Don't abort when we have nothing to copy into /dev and /var/run, or
    nothing to remove from /tmp

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:15:53 +0100

mountall (0.1.3) karmic; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems 
  * Failure to check or mount a filesystem that's not critical to the boot
    no longer results in immediate termination of mountall.
  * Failure to mount a remote filesystem no longer results in immediate
    termination of mountall, since these may be retried when other interfaces
    are brought up.
  * Improved error message output on mountall failure, temporarily enabled
    output so important messages aren't lost.
  * Removed /forcefsck after checks are complete.
