mountall (0.1.6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Restored mistakenly removed dh_installchangelogs & dh_installdocs.

  * Allow a further udev event for a block-device to retry swapon/mount
    after fsck has been already been completed for a prior event.
  * Massively reduce the pickyness of mountall when it comes to block
    devices; only expect ID_FS_USAGE and ID_FS_TYPE for dm and md devices,
    and don't actually expect the values.  For most people this won't make
    a difference, since we use UUID= anyway.  But for people with hardcoded
    /dev/sda1 in their fstab, which has multiple metadata, this won't break
    their boot.

  * Only include FHS filesystems in the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems
    events.  This prevents an unmountable entry in fstab blocking things like
    starting D-Bus or the Network which are required to mount that filesystem.
    LP: #430880.
  * Never consider the root filesystem to be virtual or remote, even when
    it is, since we assert that it's already mounted so we don't have to
    take care of it.
  * Check whether filesystems mounted readonly when we start do not have
    "ro" in their fstab, before assuming we need to remount them.
    Readonly filesystems not in fstab (e.g. LiveCD, Wubi, etc.) never need
    remounting.
  * Only virtual filesystems will be mounted while the root filesystem is
    readonly, not filesystems such as /usr and /var.
  * fuse filesystems are never considered virtual, since they probably
    need devices, write access and the hand of god to be mounted.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Ignore errors from kill in mountall-net, since they're almost certainly
    just because mountall exited before we had a chance to kill it
    LP: #430755.

mountall (0.1.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [Johan Kiviniemi]
  * Don't run fsck when the device has already been marked ready.

  [Scott James Remnant]
  * Don't abort when we have nothing to copy into /dev and /var/run, or
    nothing to remove from /tmp

mountall (0.1.3) karmic; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems 
  * Failure to check or mount a filesystem that's not critical to the boot
    no longer results in immediate termination of mountall.
  * Failure to mount a remote filesystem no longer results in immediate
    termination of mountall, since these may be retried when other interfaces
    are brought up.
  * Improved error message output on mountall failure, temporarily enabled
    output so important messages aren't lost.
  * Removed /forcefsck after checks are complete.
