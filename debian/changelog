mountall (0.1.4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [Johan Kiviniemi]
  * Don't run fsck when the device has already been marked ready.

  [Scott James Remnant]
  * Don't abort when we have nothing to copy into /dev and /var/run, or
    nothing to remove from /tmp

mountall (0.1.3) karmic; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems 
  * Failure to check or mount a filesystem that's not critical to the boot
    no longer results in immediate termination of mountall.
  * Failure to mount a remote filesystem no longer results in immediate
    termination of mountall, since these may be retried when other interfaces
    are brought up.
  * Improved error message output on mountall failure, temporarily enabled
    output so important messages aren't lost.
  * Removed /forcefsck after checks are complete.
