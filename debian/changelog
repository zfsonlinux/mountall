mountall (0.2.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Always check the root filesystem if --force-fsck is used, regardless of
    passno.  LP: #435707.

  [ Johan Kiviniemi ]
  * Have each fsck instance create a lock for each underlying physical device.
    If you have a single disk or RAID, all filesystem checks will happen
    sequentially in order to avoid thrashing.  On more complex configurations,
    youâ€™ll benefit from the parallel checks mountall has been doing all along.
    LP: #434974.

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Flush standard output and error before spawning processes to make
    capturing logs easier (otherwise we end up repeating things still in
    the buffer), and before calling exec().
  * Turn the code upside down so that each mount knows what it's waiting
    for, and allow multiple dependencies.  This makes the code much more
    readable putting the "policy" in a single function, and will make it
    much easier in future when this is done by Upstart.
  * For kernel filesystems listed in fstab, honour the order that they
    are listed in fstab.  LP: #432571, #433537, #436796
  * Always create new swap partition mounts for each fstab entry, don't
    treat them as updating the same.  LP: #435027.
  * Virtual filesystems under local or remote filesystems (and local under
    remote) don't delay the virtual or local events.  LP: #431040.
  * Simplify event emission, this has the advantage that we can now output
    what mount points we're waiting for and what they are waiting for as
    well.
  * Fixed issue with trailing slashes.  LP: #443035.
  * Only run hooks if the filesystem was not already mounted.  LP: #444252.
  * Don't clean up /tmp when run without --tmptime argument.
  * Ignore loop and ram devices until ready.  LP: #441454.
  * Add options to binfmt_misc filesystem, which will probably cause it to
    be mounted on boot as well.
  * Synchronously mount local and virtual filesystems, I suspect this is
    the real cause behind the XFS races as one will modprobe and the other
    will not (and fail).  LP: #432620.
  * Synchronously activate swap to avoid out of memory issues when checking
    the root filesystem.
  * Enumerate existing udev devices on startup, so we don't always have to
    see udev be coldplugged.
  * Don't break on general errors for non-essential filesystems.
    LP: #441144.
  * Don't repeat attempts to mount a filesystem without having first
    succeded to mount another.

mountall (0.1.8) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Further work on the fix from the previous version where the root
    filesystem would always be considered "local", retain that from the
    POV of the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems events, but do mount
    the root straight away when it's virtual since there's no device to
    wait until it's ready.  LP: #431204.
  * If a remote filesystem is already mounted and doesn't need a remount,
    don't wait for a network device to come up.  LP: #430348.

  * Ignore single and double quotes in fstab device specifications, since
    mount -a used to.  LP: #431064.
  * Never write mtab when mounting a mount with showthroughs (ie. /var)
    and instead update mtab once we've moved it into place
    later.  LP: #434172.

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * src/mountall.c: rework nftw hooks to use a global for argument passing
    instead of using nested functions and the resulting trampolines that
    cause an executable stack.  LP: #434813.
  * debian/rules: revert powerpc exception, since the cause is fixed by
    removing the nested functions.

mountall (0.1.7) karmic; urgency=low

  * Build with -O2 on powerpc to work around wrong-code generation with -Os.
    LP: #432222.

mountall (0.1.6) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Restored mistakenly removed dh_installchangelogs & dh_installdocs.

  * Allow a further udev event for a block-device to retry swapon/mount
    after fsck has been already been completed for a prior event.
  * Massively reduce the pickyness of mountall when it comes to block
    devices; only expect ID_FS_USAGE and ID_FS_TYPE for dm and md devices,
    and don't actually expect the values.  For most people this won't make
    a difference, since we use UUID= anyway.  But for people with hardcoded
    /dev/sda1 in their fstab, which has multiple metadata, this won't break
    their boot.

  * Only include FHS filesystems in the {virtual,local,remote}-filesystems
    events.  This prevents an unmountable entry in fstab blocking things like
    starting D-Bus or the Network which are required to mount that filesystem.
    LP: #430880.
  * Never consider the root filesystem to be virtual or remote, even when
    it is, since we assert that it's already mounted so we don't have to
    take care of it.  LP: #431028.
  * Check whether filesystems mounted readonly when we start do not have
    "ro" in their fstab, before assuming we need to remount them.
    Readonly filesystems not in fstab (e.g. LiveCD, Wubi, etc.) never need
    remounting.  LP: #431028.
  * Only virtual filesystems will be mounted while the root filesystem is
    readonly, not filesystems such as /usr and /var.
  * fuse filesystems are never considered virtual, since they probably
    need devices, write access and the hand of god to be mounted.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Ignore errors from kill in mountall-net, since they're almost certainly
    just because mountall exited before we had a chance to kill it
    LP: #430755.

mountall (0.1.4) karmic; urgency=low

  [Johan Kiviniemi]
  * Don't run fsck when the device has already been marked ready.

  [Scott James Remnant]
  * Don't abort when we have nothing to copy into /dev and /var/run, or
    nothing to remove from /tmp

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:15:53 +0100

mountall (0.1.3) karmic; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems 
  * Failure to check or mount a filesystem that's not critical to the boot
    no longer results in immediate termination of mountall.
  * Failure to mount a remote filesystem no longer results in immediate
    termination of mountall, since these may be retried when other interfaces
    are brought up.
  * Improved error message output on mountall failure, temporarily enabled
    output so important messages aren't lost.
  * Removed /forcefsck after checks are complete.
