.SH NAME
local-filesystems \- event signalling that local filesystems have been mounted
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B local-filesystems
.RI [ ENV ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B local-filesystems
event is generated by the
.BR mountall (8)
daemon after it has mounted all local filesystems listed in
.BR fstab (5).
.BR mountall (8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and tasks started
or stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.

This event is typically used by services that must be started in order for
remote filesystems, if any, to be activated.  Remember that some users
may not consider it wrong to place
.I /usr
on a remote filesystem.  For most normal services the
.BR filesystem (7)
event is sufficient.

This event will never occur before the
.BR virtual-filesystems (7)
event.
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
A service that wishes to be running once local filesystems are mounted
might use:

.RS
.nf
start on local-filesystems
.fi
.RE
