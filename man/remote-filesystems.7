.SH NAME
remote-filesystems \- event signalling that remote filesystems have been mounted
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B local-filesystems
.RI [ ENV ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B remote-filesystems
event is generated by the
.BR mountall (8)
daemon after it has mounted all remote filesystems listed in
.BR fstab (5).
.BR mountall (8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and tasks started
or stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.

This event is typically used by services that must be started to manage
remote filesystems.  When it occurs, local filesystems such as
.I /usr
may not be mounted.  For most normal services the
.BR filesystem (7)
event is sufficient.

This event will never occur before the
.BR virtual-filesystems (7)
event.
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
A service that wishes to be running once remote filesystems are mounted
might use:

.RS
.nf
start on remote-filesystems
.fi
.RE
