.SH NAME
mountall \- Mount filesystems during boot
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mountall
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mountall
reads
.BR fstab (5)
and calls
.BR fsck (8),
.BR mount (8)
and
.BR swapon (8)
in the correct order to mount filesystems once the underlying devices
have been created by
.BR udevd (8)

This is a temporary tool until
.BR init (8)
itself gains the necessary flexibility to perform this processing; you
should not rely on its behaviour.
