virtual-filesystems \- event signalling that virtual filesystems have been mounted
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B virtual-filesystems
.RI [ ENV ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B virtual-filesystems
event is generated by the
.BR mountall (8)
daemon after it has mounted all virtual filesystems listed in
.BR fstab (5).
.BR mountall (8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and tasks started
or stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.

This event is typically used by services that must be started in order to
mount other filesystems.  When this event occurs, common filesystems such
as
.I /usr
may not be mounted.  For most normal services the
.BR filesystem (7)
event is sufficient.
.\"
.SH EXAMPLE
A service that wishes to be running once virtual filesystems are mounted
might use:

.RS
.nf
start on virtual-filesystems
.fi
.RE
